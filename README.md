# WKXmasWindow

An interactive face tracking installation created for W+K London in 2008.

This application is to be used with the 0573 version (00573-Xcode-Fat-YCAM-WithGui.zip from: openframeworks.cc/files) of OpenFrameworks.

This is the installation that was on Redchurch street for the Holiday period of 2008.

It's currently crippled, as I don't have access to either the HTTP/FTP server for uploading of Faces, or the Fonts, or the Artwork concerned (in the background and characters folders of the data folder). I am working on the artwork permissions.

Thanks to W+K, we've now got all the graphics included. Enjoy!

OS X version tested only.
